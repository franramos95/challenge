Automation Challenge Code<br>
<br>
The solution made by using Selenium WebDrive, Java 8 and eclipse IDE.<br>
I follow the follow filters options:<br>
    • Fun Things To Do (the Spa and wellness centre's filter didn't exist anymore)<br>
    • Star rating<br>
And I create two test cases:<br>
    • iChooseFiveStartsAndSeeTheHotelTest - Verify when I select the 5 starts rating than I validate if the The Savoy Hotel show up and the George Limerick Hotel dind't show up.<br>
    • iChooseSaunaAndSeeTheHotelTest - verify when I select the sauna option than I validate if the Limerick Strand Hotel show up and the George Limerick Hotel dind't show up.<br>
<br>    
Using the Java Streams Api was possible to interate the webElement and verify a list of hotels.<br>
<br>
To run the automated test <br>
    • go to command line<br>
    • enter in the folder that you saved the project<br>
    • and run the follow command "mvn clean install"<br>
